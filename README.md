# Paralax_website
Change the link to the CSS depending on where the it is in your cace, in my case it is in the same place as the index.html
This project was made for my homework, it is a pretty simple paralax website, where a form pop up pops up when you press on a link.
The form is only for visual for now, and does not actually fill out.
